Hi ma'am.
I hope this email finds you well. My name is Lokesh Sharma, and over the past 2 days, I have been exploring various roles within Techmojo. I am particularly interested in pursuing a backend position, especially one that involves Java.
To provide some background, last year at IIIT Hyderabad, I undertook the Internals of Application course, a four-month project course designed to familiarize us with industry-standard tech stacks. As part of this course, I collaborated on developing a platform for deploying, scaling, and monitoring IoT-based applications. In this project as a BACKEND, I implemented two critical microservices: one for monitoring and fault tolerance, and another for logging. We utilized Kafka for asynchronous communication and MongoDB as the database. Additionally, I developed a tracking webpage using Node.js and React to monitor all active microservices and their instances.

Since completing this course and receiving an A-, I have been keenly exploring backend roles. While the tech stack for the course was Python, as required, I have recently delved into Spring Boot and am fascinated by its capabilities in building scalable systems.  I had one course in Java during my bachelor's, which gave me a familiarity with it.
I am excited about the prospect of contributing to techmojo and working on large-scale systems using Java and Spring Boot. I believe my background and enthusiasm for backend development align well with the goals of Techmojo which will provide a fast paced learning environment.

Thanks
